# Project Name

## Description

This is a tinyparser I created to get `title`, `description` and `image` from the `og` meta tags. It emits events on each stage.

It doesn't use any lib other than dev ones (Ts, prettier, eslint etc), Even tests I used node's test runner.

It was a fun little project inspired by hackerrank's problem (Create a parser).

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

```sh
pnpm install
```

To run tests 

```sh

```

For dev mode
